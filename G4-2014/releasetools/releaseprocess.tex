\subsubsection{Release process}
The software release process is described in the \Gfour{} policy
document~\cite{release:policy}.  It has reached a rather mature state in recent
years, with few modifications or adaptations made to the tools adopted for 
development and testing.  One adaptation was required following the migration of
the source code repository to the Subversion (SVN)~\cite{release:SVN} tool.  
This involved mainly technical updates to the tools and scripts used to package
the software, consistent with most of the principles described in the original
release policy.

A new release of the \Gfour{} software is usually issued once per year, with a
Beta preview of some of the expected new features usually torwards the end
of the second quarter of the same year.
