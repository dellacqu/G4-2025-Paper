% For specific studies at the LHC and design of future linear colliders 
% \cite{embib:lin}, a set of high energy models have been developed. 
The processes of gamma conversion to muon pairs \cite{embib:gmumu}, and positron
annihilation into muons and hadrons \cite{embib:emmu}, were implemented to assist
in the design of interaction regions within future linear colliders
\cite{embib:lind}.  Other models were added for the simulation of energy loss of
heavy exotic particles, in particular, magnetic monopoles \cite{embib:empbar}. 
Because the charges and masses of these objects are not always defined, the new 
models allow for the flexible definition of the energy ranges over which they
are valid, and are not constrained by the lower or upper limits seen in Table
\ref{Table-Ioni}.  An efficient generator for synchrotron radiation by 
relativistic electrons in magnetic fields was also implemented \cite{embib:syn}
and recently generalized to synchrotron radiation for any type of long-lived 
charged particle.
