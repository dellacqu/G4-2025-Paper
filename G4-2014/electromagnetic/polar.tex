Models for the simulation of linear polarized gamma transport are based 
on the set of Livermore gamma models: photoelectric effect \cite{embib:gamma9}, 
Rayleigh and Compton scattering \cite{embib:gamma10}, and gamma conversion. 
These models have been part of \Gfour{} for a long time.  New gamma conversion
models briefly described in Section \ref{sec:em2} also take into account linear
polarization of a primary gamma.  Also the process of positron annihilation was
updated, and now takes into account the correlation of photon polarization in 
the annihilation rest frame.

In parallel, a polarization sub-library was designed to use the standard 
gamma models \cite{embib:pol5}.  This library allows for the simulation of 
circularly polarized electrons and positrons in vacuum and in polarized media.
For a complete simulation of a low energy polarimeter setup, all processes
relevant to tracking polarized particles through matter, such as spin-dependent
Compton scattering, Bhabha-M\"{o}ller scattering, annihilation, bremsstrahlung
and pair production, were implemented.  The main application of this library is
in the design of positron sources for future linear colliders \cite{embib:pol6}.
