% \subsection{Visualization}\label{sec:viz}

\Gfour{} visualization capabilities \cite{vis:Allison} have been extended to
leverage new user interface technologies, such as Qt \cite{vis:Qt}, and to 
extend many features in response to user needs.  In many cases, visualization 
solutions that previously required extensive user coding are now provided 
through rich built-in functionality. \Gfour{} offers the user many options for
visualization drivers, some of which are always installed, others of which 
require that the user's system include particular external libraries.  
Available visualization drivers include the basic OpenGL-based \cite{vis:OGL}
drivers (OGLX, 
OGLWin32 and OGLXm), three OpenGL drivers which are more interactive (Qt, 
OpenInventor \cite{vis:OI} and OIXE) and the file-based drivers HepRApp 
\cite{vis:HPRP}, RayTracer, DAWN \cite{vis:DAWN}, VRML \cite{vis:VRML},
gMocren \cite{vis:gMoc} and ASCIITree.  Some of these drivers and new features
are detailed below.
