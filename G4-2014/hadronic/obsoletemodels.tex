\paragraph{Obsolete models}
The first \Gfour{} hadronic models, the Low Energy Parameterized (LEP) and 
High Energy Parameterized (HEP), were both re-engineered versions of the Fortran
code Gheisha \cite{hadbib:gheisha}.  In their original form they were designed
and tuned to reproduce high energy shower shapes.  They conserved energy on
average, but not on an event-by-event basis.  With the advent of more 
theoretically detailed models, both LEP and HEP models were removed from version
10.0 of the toolkit.

Prior to \Gfour{} 10.0, a number of models and cross section sets dealing
with nuclear de-excitation, hadron capture, gamma-nuclear and lepton-nuclear 
reactions were implemented by the Chiral Invariant Phase Space (CHIPS) package.
Since version 10.0, most of these reactions have been implemented by other models 
although some of the cross sections still maintain the original CHIPS coding.

Lastly, the isotope production model, used to count recoil nuclei produced in
various reactions, was removed in version 10.0, as all hadronic models now 
produce recoil nuclei explicitly.
