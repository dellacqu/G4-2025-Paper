\paragraph{Extraction of CHIPS kaon and hyperon cross sections}
The cross sections for kaons and hyperons incident upon nuclei are based on the
parameterization by Kossov and Degtyarenko who developed them as part of the 
CHIPS package \cite{hadbib:CHIPS}.  This parameterization was developed using 
extensive data samples and contains a number of parameters which depend on the
type of projectile.  With \Gfour{} 9.6 these cross sections were made 
independent of the CHIPS package and their interfaces made to conform to the 
hadronic standard in the toolkit.  They are currently used by default in 
production physics lists such as FTFP\_BERT and QGSP\_BERT.
